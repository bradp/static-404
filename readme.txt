A WordPress plugin to quickly send a 404 for missing static files.

== Description ==

Quickly output a 404 for static files that aren't found, rather than loading the normal 404 page.

Any static files ( images, text, pdfs, etc ) that don't exist will 404 as soon as possible, rather than loading the entire WordPress application.

== Availiable filters ==

By default, the list of extensions to check are the results of `wp_get_ext_types`, but can be filtered with `static_404_extensions`.

The output is a static page with the text `404 Not Found`, this text can be edited by filtering `static_404_message`.

A 404 status code will be used, but can be filtered with `static_404_response_code`.

Passing true to `static_404_should_process_request` will short-circuit and skip processing the request. This filter gets passed the current request.


== Installation ==

 - Install the plugin.
 - Magically have faster and less expensive 404s!
